🚀 Learning Big-O & Algorithm Today!

Spent some time today practicing algorithm problems and understanding Big-O notation.

💡 Key takeaways:

Algorithm → step-by-step instructions to solve a problem

Big-O → measures efficiency (time & memory)

Common types: O(1), O(n), O(n²), O(log n)

Practice is key! Solving small functions helps understand performance & scalability

Some examples I worked on:

Single & nested loops

Linear vs logarithmic loops

Constant time operations

Feeling more confident about analyzing function performance and preparing for coding challenges! 💪
